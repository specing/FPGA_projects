============
- figure out whether it is possible to bind ports of the top level entity
  that are of the record type to the pins via the constaints file of Altera Quartus?
  (XDC supports this)

Tetris
======
- tetris_active_tetrimino.vhd:
  - move state_ML_addresses and state_MR_addresses address checking
    into state_check_new_addresses? (tested some time ago ...more LUT...investigate)
    + Move address checking to after new addresses are obtained
  - have a counter produce block_select so as to vacuum 4-state groups into one
  - join Move Down and normal check_contentsX states based on operation_i?
    ^ uses two more LUTs, saved in git stash -- investigate why
  - the 8 constants at the top look weird and there are some hardcoded values in FSM next state.
- definitions.vhd:
  - UNI-VGA should probably be read by VHDL's text_io,
    then both this mapping and the constants in uni_vga.vhd automatically generated in memory.
  - in vga.display.object record, make c be an alias for .colours?
