UNI-VGA
-------

uni_vga.vhd has to be generated from the UNI-VGA package before the tetris demo can be compiled:

1) download http://www.inp.nsk.su/~bolkhov/files/fonts/univga/
2) git clone https://github.com/specing/bdf2vhdl
3) cd bdf2vhdl
4) make
5) ./bdf2vhdl -n uni_vga -b < /path/to/uni_vga/u_vga16.bdf > /path/to/FPGA_projects/tetris/uni_vga.vhd


Building tetris for Digilent Nexys4
-----------------------------------

Due to use of VHDL-2008 only Vivado is supported
(developed with v2016.2 SW build 1577090 on 2016.06.02).

1) Open Vivado and create a new project.
   (with a build directory stored elsewhere as Vivado creates a ton of files).

2) Generate uni_vga.vhd as described above

3) Include all files from directories tetris/ and tetris/board/Nexys4.
   Select all files in "Libraries" view and right click -> "Set File Type" to VHDL2008.
   Set top_level as "Top module name" on the "Project Summary" screen.
   Click on "Add Sources" -> "Add or Create Constraints" -> select pin_map.xdc from tetris/board/Nexys4.

4) Add directory library/, this time with subdirectories.
   Put all newly added files into library "flib"
     (There used to be a button for this accessible by right clicking on
     the file, but it seems to have disappeared).
   Change all newly added files's type to VHDL2008.

5) Press the "Generate Bitstream" button.
